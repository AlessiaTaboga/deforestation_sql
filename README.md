## Udacity SQL Nanodegree

## Project 1: Deforestation Exploration

This is project 1 of the Udacity SQL Nanodegree, completed in May 2022.

### Introduction
ForestQuery is a non-profit organization, on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and which raises awareness about this environmental topic.

The executive director and her leadership team members are looking to understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area, both in terms of amount and percent of total area. The hope is that these findings can help inform initiatives, communications, and personnel allocation to achieve the largest impact with the precious few resources that the organization has at its disposal.
As data analyst, I will query a database to answer some of the most important questions and to prepare a report for the leadership team to provide them with an overview of global deforestation between 1990 and 2016.
### Data
Database is provided by Udacity and comprises of three tables:
-	forest_area
-	land_area
-	regions

Udacity provided also a template for the report, to be filled and submitted as pdf.

### Report
The report includes 5 sections, which I have completed for the project:
1.	Global Situation
2.	Regional Outlook
3.	Country-Level Detail
4.	Recommendations
5.	Appendix: SQL queries used

### SQL queries
All my SQL queries were executed on the Udacity workspace and can be found in the appendix of my report (deforestation_report_SQL.pdf), from page 6.
